# Network-Jubeat-Keypad
A small C# program to parse UDP packets from a LÖVE iOS program to use with Jubeat Analyser

## Quickstart
1. Sideload LÖVE onto your iPad. I use [this build](https://love2d.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=85139). (yes, I commented on that thread a *long* time ago)
2. Open up `client.love` as a zip file and edit the IP address to point to your PC's
3. Add `client.love` to the LÖVE app via file sharing (use iTunes directly, or iFunBox)
4. Make sure the iPad and PC are on the same network
5. Launch NetworkKeyboard first, and then `client.love` through the sideloaded app

Keys are mapped to the default Jubeat Analyser ones. (i.e. 4-7, r-u, f-j, v-m)
